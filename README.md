# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
A multiple linear model was generated using mechacar_mpg.csv. The linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar protypes using vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD as the independent variables. Below is an image of the linear regression model and the summary of the model.

* The results shows that vehicle length and ground clearance were the two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 

* The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-values of the linear model was smaller than the significance level, providing sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 

* The linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the r-squared value is 0.715 which means that there is 71.5% chance that future data points will fit this model. 


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils 
The images below display two data frames with summary statistics about the suspension coilâ€™s PSI across multiple manufacturing lots individually and all together. The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.  In the first image its shows that the design specification for all manufacturing lots in total meets that requirement. However, individually not all lot meet that requirement. Lot 1 and 2 meet the requirement because lot 1 variance value is 0.98 and lot 2 variance value is 7.47 which both are below the allocated weight per square inch.  In lot 3 the variance value is 170.29 which exceeds the limit, which is demonstrated in the second image.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
The next task in this analysis is to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. The null hypothesis is that there is no statistical difference, and the alternative hypothesis is that there is a statistical difference. The p-value for all lots was 0.060, which means that the p-value is below the threshold significance level and that there is enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the PSI mean of all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean. However, the p-values for lot 1= 1, lot 2=0.61, and lot 3= 0.04, which means that lot 1 and 2 are statistically different from the population mean except for lot 3. The PSI for lot 3 is not statistically different from the population mean of 1500. 

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition 
A statistical study I would perform would be a study that determine cost and maintenance cost of MechaCar compared to the competition using a linear model. The data needed for the study would cost and maintenance cost of MechaCar prototypes.  The cost and maintenance cost would be the metrics to test. The null hypothesis would be that the slope of the linear model is zero and the alternative hypothesis would be that the slope is not zero. In order to test the hypothesis, I would use a simple linear regression. This would help determine if we can quantify how MechaCar performs against the competition.
